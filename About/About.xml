  <description>Crude Bionics adds several artificial body parts for colonists. They operate at 115% efficiency, and are meant as a way to augment colonists early with fewer resources than Bionic body parts. They take half as much work to craft compared to Bionic parts.

Each installed crude bionic will apply a -5 moodlet to the pawn, due to the scratchy, unfinished nature of the components used to make it.

I took these bionic items from the mod 'Questionable Ethics' and made them into a standalone mod to increase mod compatibility. See the mod description page for more details.</description>
