# Crude Bionics
Crude Bionics adds several artificial body parts for colonists. They operate at 115% efficiency, and are meant as a way to augment colonists early with fewer resources than Bionic body parts. Each installed crude bionic will apply a -5 mood debuff to the pawn, due to the scratchy, unfinished nature of the components used to make it.

I took these bionic items from the mod 'Questionable Ethics' and made them into a standalone mod to increase mod compatibility. There are no significant changes from the crude bionics in Questionable Ethics.

## Why use Crude Bionics?
Crude bionics can give your colonists a boost in efficiency early without a lot of resource expenditure. However, they will give your colonists a permanent -5 moodlet, because they are crude and scratchy. This mood debuff stacks when additional crude bionics are applied. Maybe you want that, with some pawns...

Transform your colonists into weapons of war by replacing their arms with Crude Bludgeons, Crude Spikes, or even a Ranged Weapon Platform.

## Crude Bionic Items

crude bionic leg | 30 | 5
crude bionic spine | 30 | 6

## Can I use this on an existing save?
Yes. 

If you have any of these bionics in a save with Questionable Ethics enabled, they will function after adding this mod (the defNames were not changed).
